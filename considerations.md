# Considerations

## Circular arcs
We support the proposal to add circular arcs to JSON-FG. Dutch base registry data from the large scale topography dataset (BGT) contains a lot of arcs. We created some small test files containing such arcs and it seems that this costs little effort to support, and satisfies a requirement that is not uncommon.
